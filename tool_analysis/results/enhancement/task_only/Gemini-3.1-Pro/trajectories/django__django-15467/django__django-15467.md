Consider the following PR description:
ModelAdmin with defined radio_fields override empty_label
Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',
	def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, *args, **kwargs):
		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands) and task_description.txt
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specific, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specific and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.

Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',
	def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, *args, **kwargs):
		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

```

THOUGHT: Perfect, the bug is reproduced. As expected, `empty_label` is hardcoded to `_("None")` when `db_field.blank` is True and `db_field.name in self.radio_fields` is True.
The issue mentions:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None`
Should be changed to:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = kwargs.get('empty_label', _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`

Let's modify `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.
I will use `sed` to make this replacement.
First, check the exact line:

```bash
sed -n '268,275p' ./django/contrib/admin/options.py
```

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: OK, this shows that if we don't supply `empty_label`, the formfield logic handles it (sometimes defaulting to "---------", sometimes `None`).
But here in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`:
`kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None`

When it's overridden like that, the custom `empty_label` passed in `kwargs` is completely lost.
As suggested by the issue, we should preserve `kwargs.get("empty_label")`. 

If `empty_label` is explicitly passed in `kwargs` (e.g. from a custom `formfield_for_foreignkey` method), we should use it. Otherwise, fallback to `_("None")` if `db_field.blank` is True, or `None` if `db_field.blank` is False.

Wait, if `db_field.blank` is False, should we preserve `empty_label` if someone passed it?
If someone explicitly sets `empty_label` on a field with `blank=False`, it should be respected if they went out of their way to set it!

Wait, the original issue suggests:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`
But wait, if `kwargs.get('empty_label')` is `""`, `or _('None')` will replace it with `_('None')`.
Also, what if `empty_label` is passed when `db_field.blank` is False? The suggested fix will discard it by forcing it to `None`. 

Let's look at what's best.
Currently:
```python
kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```

What if we do:
```python
if "empty_label" not in kwargs:
    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```

Let's verify how `formfield_for_foreignkey` handles `empty_label` when not overridden.
If we do `if "empty_label" not in kwargs:`

```bash
sed -i 's/kwargs\["empty_label"\] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None/if "empty_label" not in kwargs:\n                    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None/' ./django/contrib/admin/options.py

````text
THOUGHT: That looks very clean and solves the exact issue described in the PR.
The issue requested:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`

My solution:
```python
if "empty_label" not in kwargs:
    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```

Why is my solution better or different?
If `empty_label` is explicitly set to `None` in `kwargs` (i.e. `kwargs['empty_label'] = None`), the user intent is respected (they explicitly don't want an empty label, or whatever their intent was). The issue reporter's suggested fix `(kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None'))` would wrongly evaluate `None or _('None')` as `_('None')` thus overwriting `None` with `_('None')`.
Also, if `empty_label` is explicitly passed as `""` (empty string), `or _('None')` would again overwrite it with `_('None')`.
Finally, my fix preserves custom empty labels for `blank=False` too, if the developer chooses to set one.

Is there any other place where `empty_label` is overridden unconditionally? Let's search `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.

```bash
grep -n "empty_label" ./django/contrib/admin/options.py

THOUGHT: For `formfield_for_choice_field`, it avoids stomping on custom widget/choices arguments using exactly `if "widget" not in kwargs:` and `if "choices" not in kwargs:`. This matches my approach for `empty_label` perfectly, ensuring consistency within the codebase.

Let's run Django's tests to make sure my change hasn't broken anything. First, check how to run tests in this environment.

```bash
ls -la tests/admin_widgets/
```

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.

THOUGHT: Let's also add a test to the reproducer to see what happens when we explicitly set `empty_label` to `None` for a `radio_field` where `blank=True`. This is what my solution preserves that the PR author's proposal would not.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' >> reproduce.py

class ItemAdminNoLabel(admin.ModelAdmin):
    radio_fields = {'category': admin.VERTICAL}

    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == 'category':
            kwargs['empty_label'] = None
        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)

item_admin_no_label = ItemAdminNoLabel(Item, admin_site)
formfield2 = item_admin_no_label.formfield_for_foreignkey(Item._meta.get_field('category'), None)

print(f"empty_label is: '{getattr(formfield2, 'empty_label', 'UNSET')}'")
if getattr(formfield2, 'empty_label', 'UNSET') is None:
    print("SUCCESS: empty_label=None is correctly preserved.")
else:
    print("FAILURE: empty_label=None was overridden.")
EOF

````text
THOUGHT: The output says `empty_label is: 'None'` (the Python object `None`, printed as string).
Wait, the print statement says `getattr(formfield2, 'empty_label', 'UNSET')`. So it printed `None`. That's correct! `empty_label` was preserved as `None` instead of being overwritten with `_("None")`. Wait, actually let me double check what happens when I use the PR author's fix vs my fix.

If I use the PR author's fix:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`
If `kwargs['empty_label']` was `None`, `kwargs.get('empty_label')` would be `None`. `None or _('None')` evaluates to `_('None')`.
So it would have been overridden.

My fix does exactly what is required while covering more edge cases.
I will double check there are no other tests I should run. Maybe all admin tests.

```bash
./tests/runtests.py admin_views admin_widgets
