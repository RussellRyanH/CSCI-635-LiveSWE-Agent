Consider the following PR description:
call_command fails when argument of required mutually exclusive group is passed in kwargs.
Description
	
This error 
django.core.management.base.CommandError: Error: one of the arguments --shop-id --shop is required
is raised when I run 
call_command('my_command', shop_id=1)
the argument 'shop_id' is part of a required mutually exclusive group:
shop = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
shop.add_argument('--shop-id', nargs='?', type=int, default=None, dest='shop_id')
shop.add_argument('--shop', nargs='?', type=str, default=None, dest='shop_name')
However, everything is fine when I call this command in this way:
call_command('my_command, '--shop-id=1')
In django sources I found that only those keyword arguments of call_command are passed to the parser that are defined as required:
# Any required arguments which are passed in via '**options' must be passed
# to parse_args().
parse_args += [
	'{}={}'.format(min(opt.option_strings), arg_options[opt.dest])
	for opt in parser._actions if opt.required and opt.dest in options
]
but in this special case both of them individually are not required, they are actually part of a group that is required. And the code of call_command does nothing with groups defined in the parser.

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands) and task_description.txt
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specific, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specific and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Remember: call_command fails when argument of required mutually exclusive group is passed in kwargs.

THOUGHT: The code in `call_command` uses a helper function `get_actions(parser)` to recursively get actions, including those in subparsers.
Currently it defines `get_actions(parser)` as:
```python
    def get_actions(parser):
        # Parser actions and actions from sub-parser choices.
        for opt in parser._actions:
            if isinstance(opt, _SubParsersAction):
                for sub_opt in opt.choices.values():
                    yield from get_actions(sub_opt)
            else:
                yield opt
```
If we want to extract mutually exclusive required options recursively, we should add a similar helper or combine it, or we could just traverse groups the same way. But wait, `parser_actions` already contains all actions, including sub-parser actions! If we just look at the groups in `parser._mutually_exclusive_groups`, we might miss the groups in the sub-parsers. Let's fix that.

Let me examine the `django/core/management/__init__.py` file again.

```bash
sed -n '124,142p' django/core/management/__init__.py

the argument 'shop_id' is part of a required mutually exclusive group:
shop = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
shop.add_argument('--shop-id', nargs='?', type=int, default=None, dest='shop_id')
shop.add_argument('--shop', nargs='?', type=str, default=None, dest='shop_name')
However, everything is fine when I call this command in this way:
call_command('my_command, '--shop-id=1')
In django sources I found that only those keyword arguments of call_command are passed to the parser that are defined as required:
# Any required arguments which are passed in via '**options' must be passed
# to parse_args().
parse_args += [
	'{}={}'.format(min(opt.option_strings), arg_options[opt.dest])
	for opt in parser._actions if opt.required and opt.dest in options
]
but in this special case both of them individually are not required, they are actually part of a group that is required. And the code of call_command does nothing with groups defined in the parser.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Remember: call_command fails when argument of required mutually exclusive group is passed in kwargs.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: The test failures are due to a `UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters`. This is likely an environment issue (e.g. `LC_ALL` or `LANG` not being set to UTF-8) rather than an issue with the code I touched. To be absolutely sure, I will set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` and run the tests again. The `user_commands` tests which I actually care about probably all passed.

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 ./tests/runtests.py user_commands admin_scripts
```

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: To be completely sure my changes haven't caused these test failures, I'll check out the original `django/core/management/__init__.py`, run the tests, and verify the same errors happen. This will confirm the tests are failing independently of my code. I will use `PYTHONUTF8=1` or `LC_ALL=C.UTF-8` just in case, but checking out the original code is the definitive way.

```bash
git checkout django/core/management/__init__.py && ./tests/runtests.py user_commands admin_scripts

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Remember: call_command fails when argument of required mutually exclusive group is passed in kwargs.
Description
	
This error 
django.core.management.base.CommandError: Error: one of the arguments --shop-id --shop is required
is raised when I run 
call_command('my_command', shop_id=1)
the argument 'shop_id' is part of a required mutually exclusive group:
shop = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
shop.add_argument('--shop-id', nargs='?', type=int, default=None, dest='shop_id')
shop.add_argument('--shop', nargs='?', type=str, default=None, dest='shop_name')
However, everything is fine when I call this command in this way:
call_command('my_command, '--shop-id=1')
In django sources I found that only those keyword arguments of call_command are passed to the parser that are defined as required:
# Any required arguments which are passed in via '**options' must be passed
# to parse_args().
parse_args += [
	'{}={}'.format(min(opt.option_strings), arg_options[opt.dest])
	for opt in parser._actions if opt.required and opt.dest in options
]
but in this special case both of them individually are not required, they are actually part of a group that is required. And the code of call_command does nothing with groups defined in the parser.

THOUGHT: I'll re-apply my refined fix to `django/core/management/__init__.py` and then run the `user_commands` test suite to verify that I didn't break any core behaviors while correctly fixing the bug. The test failures previously observed were just Unicode environment issues in `admin_scripts`.

```bash
git checkout django/core/management/__init__.py && python fix_call_command2.py && ./tests/runtests.py user_commands

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: I've successfully implemented and tested the fix. By extending `get_actions` to build a set of mutually exclusive required options recursively and then modifying the list comprehension for `parse_args` to include items from this set, `call_command` will correctly identify and pass any kwargs that are part of required mutually exclusive groups without individually requiring every single mutually exclusive argument. This satisfies all details of the PR description while fitting elegantly within the existing codebase structure.
