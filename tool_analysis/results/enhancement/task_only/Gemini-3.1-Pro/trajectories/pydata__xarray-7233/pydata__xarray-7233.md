Consider the following PR description:
ds.Coarsen.construct demotes non-dimensional coordinates to variables
### What happened?

`ds.Coarsen.construct` demotes non-dimensional coordinates to variables

### What did you expect to happen?

All variables that were coordinates before the coarsen.construct stay as coordinates afterwards.

### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example

```Python
In [3]: da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=["time"])
   ...: da = da.assign_coords(day=365 * da)
   ...: ds = da.to_dataset(name="T")

In [4]: ds
Out[4]: 
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (time: 24)
Coordinates:
    day      (time) int64 0 365 730 1095 1460 1825 ... 6935 7300 7665 8030 8395
Dimensions without coordinates: time
Data variables:
    T        (time) int64 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands) and task_description.txt
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specific, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specific and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: I'll start by creating a reproduction script based on the minimal reproducible example provided in the PR description to verify the bug.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > reproduce.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=["time"])
da = da.assign_coords(day=365 * da)
ds = da.to_dataset(name="T")

print("Before coarsen.construct:")
print(ds)

print("\nAfter coarsen.construct:")
res = ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=("year", "month"))
print(res)

if "day" in res.data_vars:
    print("\nBUG REPRODUCED: 'day' was demoted to a data variable.")
else:
    print("\nBUG NOT REPRODUCED OR FIXED: 'day' is a coordinate.")

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.

THOUGHT: Let me examine the rest of `construct` in `Coarsen`. I see line 880 is in `Coarsen`. Let's check `DatasetCoarsen` which is defined later. Wait, line 1070 is `DatasetCoarsen`, which is later than 880. Let me find the `construct` implementation that is actually used for `Dataset` or check if `DatasetCoarsen` has its own `construct` or if it's relying on `DatasetCoarsen.construct` (line 1146 maybe?). Wait, let me just check all `def construct` in `rolling.py`.

THOUGHT: The code block for constructing the reshaped Dataset sets everything into `reshaped` (which is a new `Dataset()`), treating everything as data variables initially since `reshaped[key] = ...` adds it as a data variable.
Then it sets coords using: `should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)`.
This only restores coordinates if their names are in `window_dim`. But `window_dim` holds the dimensions being coarsened! If there are non-dimensional coordinates (like `day` in the example, which is a coordinate over the `time` dimension, but its name is `day`, not `time`), `day` is not in `window_dim`.

Wait, the condition is `should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)`.
Wait! `day` is a coordinate. Its name is `"day"`. The dimension being coarsened is `"time"`, so `window_dim` has keys like `"time"`. So `"day"` is not in `window_dim`.

The correct logic should be: any variable that was a coordinate in the original dataset should be a coordinate in the new dataset.
So `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`? No, `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`. But wait, `window_dim` maps from original dimension names to tuples of new dimension names (e.g. `time` -> `(year, month)`).
If `time` was a coordinate, it's dropped, and its values are not preserved by `construct`. But if it is preserved (is it?), no, `time` is not even in the variables after reshape, unless it is preserved. Actually, `obj.variables.items()` iterates over all variables including coordinates.
Wait, if `time` was a coordinate, does it get reshaped?
Let's modify `should_be_coords` to include all coords from `self.obj.coords` that are present in the `reshaped` Dataset.

Wait, if a coordinate has the same name as a dimension in `window_dim`, like `time` -> `("year", "month")`, does `time` still exist?
Wait, `self.obj.coords` are names of coordinates.
If `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`, then `reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)` will try to set any coordinate from the original dataset as a coordinate in the new dataset. BUT some of the original coordinates might have been dropped or renamed?
In `Coarsen.construct`, we loop over `obj.variables.items()`. So all variables (including coordinates) are copied over and reshaped into `reshaped`.
Wait, if a variable was a coordinate named `time`, and its dims were `("time",)`, it gets reshaped to `("year", "month")`. Its name in `reshaped` is still `time`! Wait, no, `time` becomes a variable of dimensions `("year", "month")`. Let's test this by checking what happens to `time`.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > test_time.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=["time"])
da = da.assign_coords(day=365 * da)
da = da.assign_coords(time=np.arange(24))
ds = da.to_dataset(name="T")

print("Before coarsen.construct:")
print(ds)

res = ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=("year", "month"))

THOUGHT: Oh, I see! `should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)` meant that it only kept coordinates if they were listed in `window_dim` (which happens to be `{"time": ("year", "month")}`). Wait, if `window_dim` is `{"time": ("year", "month")}`, then `set(window_dim)` is `{"time"}`.
So `should_be_coords` is only keeping `time` as a coordinate.

It should simply keep all variables that were originally coordinates as coordinates!
Wait, but what if a coordinate is renamed? In `construct`, variables aren't renamed, their dimensions are reshaped. The name of the variable itself stays the same.
So we can just use `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords) & set(reshaped.variables)`. Wait, since `reshaped` has the same variables as `obj` but with different dimensions, `set(self.obj.coords)` should just work. Or maybe `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`. Wait, since all variables are copied over to `reshaped`, their keys are the same!

Let's modify `xarray/core/rolling.py` where `should_be_coords` is computed.
I will change:
```python
        should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)
        result = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)
```
to:
```python
        should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)
        result = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)
```

Let's check if there are any edge cases. What if a variable was a coordinate, but due to `construct` it somehow disappears? No, `for key, var in obj.variables.items():` loops over all variables and adds them to `reshaped`.
What about `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`? Is that safe? Yes, `set_coords` ignores keys that are not present, or maybe it raises an error?
Let's see the implementation of `set_coords` in `Dataset`.
If I look at `dataset.set_coords`, it accepts names of variables to convert to coordinates. If a name is not present, it might raise an error. However, since we iterate over all `obj.variables.items()`, we are guaranteed that all variables in `self.obj` are present in `reshaped`.

Let's use `sed` to replace this line in `xarray/core/rolling.py` and run tests.

```bash
sed -i 's/should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)/should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)/g' xarray/core/rolling.py && python reproduce.py

THOUGHT: `DatasetRolling.construct` handles coords using `coords=self.obj.coords` in the initialization of the `Dataset`. Since `self.obj.coords` maps to variables that exist in `dataset`, it successfully keeps them as coordinates. Wait, no. The line `Dataset(dataset, coords=self.obj.coords, attrs=attrs)` might have issues if the coords get stacked/reshaped. Wait, it doesn't even loop over `self.obj.coords` for `dataset` dictionary! It only loops over `self.obj.data_vars.items()`. Wait! Let's check `DatasetRolling.construct` from lines 753-788.

```python
        dataset = {}
        for key, da in self.obj.data_vars.items():
            ...
        return Dataset(dataset, coords=self.obj.coords, attrs=attrs).isel(...)
```

Ah, `DatasetRolling.construct` doesn't reshape the coordinates at all unless they are passed as `coords=...` and somehow `Dataset` handles rolling them? No! `self.obj.coords` are passed as-is. So they are not "rolled" or reshaped. Let's test `Rolling.construct` to see if coordinates are handled correctly or if there is a similar bug.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > test_rolling.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(24), dims=["time"])
da = da.assign_coords(day=365 * da)
da = da.assign_coords(time=np.arange(24))
ds = da.to_dataset(name="T")

THOUGHT: Okay, for `Rolling.construct`, coordinates are NOT "rolled" because rolling adds a new dimension (`window`), and coordinates usually don't need to depend on the window dimension (unless explicitly intended, but currently they are just passed over as-is, with their original dimensions). Wait! Is `Rolling.construct` not doing what users expect?
Ah, if a coordinate depends on `time`, it remains of shape `(time: 24)`. But for `Coarsen.construct`, the original dimension `time` is REPLACED by `("year", "month")`. So a coordinate of shape `(time: 24)` MUST be reshaped to `("year", "month")` because `time` no longer exists! That's why `Coarsen.construct` iterates over all `obj.variables.items()` (which includes both `data_vars` and `coords`), while `Rolling.construct` iterates over `obj.data_vars.items()` and just passes `coords=self.obj.coords`.

Let me review `Rolling.construct` to double check that `Rolling.construct` does what is documented, just in case. But anyway, the bug report is strictly about `ds.Coarsen.construct`.
The change I made in `Coarsen.construct`:
```python
        should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)
        result = reshaped.set_coords(should_be_coords)
```
Fixes the issue perfectly. Let me inspect `git diff` to make sure the change is exactly as I intended.

```bash
git diff

THOUGHT: The change looks correct and clean. The original implementation mistakenly intersected the original coordinates with `window_dim` (which holds the names of the original dimensions being coarsened). Thus it only kept coordinates that shared a name with the coarsened dimension, and demoted all non-dimensional coordinates (and coordinates from non-coarsened dimensions) to data variables.

By changing it to `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`, all original coordinates are accurately identified and restored to coordinates after the reshape step in `Coarsen.construct`. The variable content of `reshaped` isn't affected (all original variables are still properly constructed and transferred into the new object in lines 964-974), so this only affects `set_coords`. Any coordinate from the original dataset that still exists in `reshaped` (which should be all of them) will be correctly labeled as a coordinate.

Let's double check if there are other usages of `set(window_dim)` that might be incorrect.

```bash
grep -n "set(window_dim)" xarray/core/rolling.py
```

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Remember: ds.Coarsen.construct demotes non-dimensional coordinates to variables
### What happened?

`ds.Coarsen.construct` demotes non-dimensional coordinates to variables

### What did you expect to happen?

All variables that were coordinates before the coarsen.construct stay as coordinates afterwards.

THOUGHT: I have successfully fixed the bug where non-dimensional coordinates were demoted to variables in `ds.Coarsen.construct`. The issue was caused by an incorrect intersection logic that only preserved coordinates sharing names with the coarsened dimensions (`window_dim`).

I modified the code to preserve all coordinates that were present in the original dataset by using `should_be_coords = set(self.obj.coords)`.

I also ran `pytest xarray/tests/test_rolling.py` which completed successfully with 0 errors. Now I am ready to submit my changes.
