Consider the following PR description:
models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.
Description
	
I have models which inherit from other models, and they should inherit the primary key. This works fine with Django 3.1. However, if I install Django 3.2 alpha, when I run make_migrations I get the following error messages:
System check identified some issues:

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands) and task_description.txt
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specific, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specific and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description.
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Remember: models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.

THOUGHT: The logic in `_check_default_pk` is:
```python
    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden
        ):
            return [
```
Wait, if `cls._meta.pk.auto_created` is True, it triggers. The user says:
"These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from."

Let's test reproducing the issue. I will write a test case to create a model with a manual primary key, then inherit from it, and check if `W042` is raised for the child class.

THOUGHT: Okay, the reproduction is successful!
If a child model inherits from a parent model that explicitly sets its primary key (e.g. `my_pk = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)`), Django 3.2 is incorrectly giving `W042` to the child model.
Wait, let me look at `cls._meta.pk.auto_created`.
In the child model, the `_meta.pk` is actually an auto-created primary key? No, wait, if `User` inherits from `Entity`, `User`'s primary key is the `OneToOneField` to `Entity` (the `entity_ptr_id`).
Let's print what `User._meta.pk` is in the script.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' >> test_issue.py

print(User._meta.pk)
print(type(User._meta.pk))
print(User._meta.pk.auto_created)

THOUGHT: Ah, so for multi-table inheritance, Django creates a `OneToOneField` implicitly. This field has `auto_created=True`. But `W042` is meant to warn about auto-created `AutoField` primary keys when `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is not explicitly set, because people migrating to Django 3.2 might get unexpected `BigAutoField` transitions or might want to set a global default. However, a `OneToOneField` mapping to a parent model is NOT an `AutoField`.

Let's check if the `User._meta.pk` is an `AutoField` or an `OneToOneField` pointing to a parent. It's a `OneToOneField`. We shouldn't warn if the primary key is not an `AutoField` (or an instance of a class that inherits from AutoField? Actually, the warning is specific to the "default primary key", which is generated in `django/db/models/options.py`).

Let's inspect `_check_default_pk` logic in `django/db/models/base.py`:
```python
    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden
        ):

Wait, what if the user *did* get an `AutoField` auto-created by Django?
Let's trace how auto-created primary keys are added in `Options._prepare`.

```bash
python edit.py read django/db/models/options.py --start 240 --end 290

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

## LLM response

THOUGHT: Ah, wait. If `self.pk is None` and `self.parents` is not empty, Django promotes the first parent link (a `OneToOneField`) to be the primary key:
```python
        if self.pk is None:
            if self.parents:
                # Promote the first parent link in lieu of adding yet another
                # field.
                field = next(iter(self.parents.values()))
                # Look for a local field with the same name as the
                # first parent link. If a local field has already been
                # created, use it instead of promoting the parent
                already_created = [fld for fld in self.local_fields if fld.name == field.name]
                if already_created:
                    field = already_created[0]
                field.primary_key = True
                self.setup_pk(field)
```
And this `OneToOneField` happens to be auto-created (in `django/db/models/base.py`, around line 199 where `parent_link` is created). Because the parent link has `auto_created=True`, it triggers `models.W042`. But the purpose of `models.W042` is to warn about an implicit `AutoField`, not an implicit `OneToOneField` parent link. 

Wait, the check is in `django/db/models/base.py`:
```python
    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden
        ):
            return [
```
Maybe we should just check if `cls._meta.pk` is actually an `AutoField`?
Or check if `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)`?
Wait, if someone explicitly inherits from `AutoField` but sets `auto_created=True` (which they shouldn't, but Django's internal code does this for the default PK).
Is `W042` only about `AutoField`? Let's check `_get_default_pk_class()` in `django/db/models/options.py`:
```python
    def _get_default_pk_class(self):
        pk_class_path = getattr(
            self.app_config,
            'default_auto_field',
            settings.DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD,
        )
        if self.app_config and self.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden:
            app_config_class = type(self.app_config)
            source = (
                f"{app_config_class.__module__}."
                f"{app_config_class.__qualname__}.default_auto_field"
            )
        else:
            source = 'DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD'
        if not pk_class_path:
            raise ImproperlyConfigured(f"{source} must not be empty.")
        try:
            pk_class = import_string(pk_class_path)
        except ImportError as e:
            msg = (
                f"{source} refers to the module '{pk_class_path}' that could "
                f"not be imported."
            )
            raise ImproperlyConfigured(msg) from e
        if not issubclass(pk_class, AutoField):
            raise ValueError(
                f"Primary key '{pk_class_path}' referred by {source} must "
                f"subclass AutoField."
            )
        return pk_class
```
So yes, the warning is meant to help people who implicitly get an `AutoField` because they didn't define a PK type and `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is not set.
If the primary key is a parent link (`isinstance(cls._meta.pk, OneToOneField)` or similar), it is NOT an auto-created `AutoField` in the sense of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.

Let's test if making it check for `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)` solves the issue.

```bash
cat << 'EOF' > patch_base.py
import re

with open('django/db/models/base.py', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Find the _check_default_pk method
pattern = r"    @classmethod\n    def _check_default_pk\(cls\):\n        if \(\n            cls\._meta\.pk\.auto_created and"
replacement = """    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden
        ):
"""

# Let's read and see exactly what to replace
EOF

THOUGHT: Actually, let's see what happens if I check whether the primary key is an `AutoField` (specifically `django.db.models.fields.AutoField`).
Wait! In `django/db/models/base.py`, we can import `AutoField` or just `cls._meta.pk.__class__ == AutoField` or similar? Wait, the model might have been auto-assigned a `BigAutoField`, which is also an `AutoField`. The warning is precisely about the *auto-created primary key* which is a subclass of `AutoField`.
Actually, if the primary key is `auto_created` but NOT an `AutoField`, does it even make sense to trigger the warning? The warning text literally says "point to a subclass of AutoField...".
Let's modify `_check_default_pk` to also check `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)`. Or rather, `cls._meta.pk.is_relation`? If it's a `OneToOneField`, it's not an `AutoField`.
Let's see if `AutoField` is available in `django/db/models/base.py`.

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

THOUGHT: I'll add `AutoField` to the imports at line 19 in `django/db/models/base.py`. Wait, `django.db.models.fields` has `AutoField`, or it can be imported from `django.db.models`. In `base.py` there is:
```python
from django.db.models import (
    NOT_PROVIDED, ExpressionWrapper, IntegerField, Max, Value,
)
```
Wait, wait. `AutoField` is indeed in `django.db.models.fields`. I can just import `AutoField` from `django.db.models.fields` or `django.db.models`. Let me import it from `django.db.models.fields`.

Actually, maybe I can just do: `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)` in `_check_default_pk`.
Wait, is there any chance that someone explicitly creates an auto-created primary key that is not an `AutoField`? `Options._prepare` explicitly raises `ValueError` if `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` doesn't subclass `AutoField`.
So checking `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)` is perfectly safe and semantically correct: the warning W042 is about `AutoField`.
Wait, `django.db.models.base.py` line 1298:
```python
    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden
        ):
```
I'll replace it with:
```python
    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden and
            cls._meta.pk.__class__.__name__ == 'AutoField'
        ):
```
Wait, if it's a `BigAutoField` (which is a subclass of `AutoField`), the warning shouldn't be raised if it's auto-created?
No, the warning is because the default was `AutoField` and it might change to `BigAutoField`. If the default *is* `AutoField`, the class is exactly `AutoField`. Wait, if they set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.AutoField'`, `is_overridden` is True, so it skips the check.
If they don't set it, `cls._meta.pk` will be the default, which is `django.db.models.AutoField`.
If `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)` is used, wait. `BigAutoField` inherits from `AutoField`. Would `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)` be True for `BigAutoField`? Yes.
But what if the default auto field *is* configured via `AppConfig.default_auto_field`, but they want to override something?
`isinstance` requires importing `AutoField`. Is `AutoField` already available in `django/db/models/base.py`? Let's search.

```bash
grep -n "AutoField" django/db/models/base.py
```

I'll replace `cls._meta.pk.auto_created and` with `cls._meta.pk.auto_created and isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField) and`.

Let's make sure that running Django's test suite doesn't break. I will run `tests/check_framework` and `tests/model_inheritance` just to be safe. Wait, `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` defines `AutoField`. So it should work.

Wait! I should run tests specifically about `checks`.

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

THOUGHT: The tests pass and my fix successfully addresses the issue.
But let me double check the import `from django.db.models.fields import AutoField` at the top of `django/db/models/base.py`. Let's ensure `base.py` parses without syntax errors and without circular import issues. Since I just ran `tests/runtests.py check_framework model_inheritance` and everything passed, there's no circular import issue.

Wait, is there any other place where `_check_default_pk` is used? No, it's just `django/db/models/base.py` on `cls.check()`.
Wait, is there an equivalent check for other models? No, W042 is raised entirely by `_check_default_pk`.

Let me run all tests to be completely safe? No, that would take too long. Maybe just `tests/runtests.py models`?

```bash
./tests/runtests.py models
```

THOUGHT: There is no `models` test app, that's fine. The tests pass.
Is there any risk that an explicit integer PK could be `auto_created` but not an `AutoField`? `auto_created` is an internal Django mechanism mostly for default AutoField PKs, ManyToMany intermediate tables, and implicitly created `OneToOneField` for multi-table inheritance. So yes, `W042` ONLY applies to default AutoField PKs.

Let's inspect the `git diff` to make sure the patch is completely correct and nicely formatted.

```bash
git diff
```

THOUGHT: The change is perfect. `cls._meta.pk.auto_created` could be an implicitly generated `OneToOneField` when the model implicitly links to its parent table. If it's a `OneToOneField`, `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField)` is `False` and it won't raise the warning. `BigAutoField`, `SmallAutoField` are subclasses of `AutoField` so they will correctly trigger the check when they're auto_created and DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD wasn't customized (though default is `AutoField`).

I've tested the reproduction and it correctly no longer raises the error. `check_framework` and `model_inheritance` test suites have also passed. The fix seems fully solid.

Now I will wrap things up and submit my code. Let me check my working directory. I will remove `edit.py`, `patch_base.py`, `patch_base2.py`, `patch_import.py`, `testapp`, `test_issue.py`. Wait, `git add -A` will capture them if I don't delete. I should delete the non-Django files before submitting.

```bash
rm -rf edit.py patch_base.py patch_base2.py patch_import.py testapp test_issue.py

THOUGHT: Checking once again the `django/db/models/base.py` modified lines:

```python
    @classmethod
    def _check_default_pk(cls):
        if (
            cls._meta.pk.auto_created and
            isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField) and
            not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and
            not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden
        ):
```

This perfectly solves the issue that `auto_created` could be `True` for parent links in multi-table inheritance (which are `OneToOneField` instances, not `AutoField`s). 

I'm ready to submit.

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
