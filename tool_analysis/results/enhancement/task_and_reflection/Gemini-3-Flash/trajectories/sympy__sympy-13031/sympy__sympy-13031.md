Consider the following PR description:
Behavior of Matrix hstack and vstack changed in sympy 1.1
In sympy 1.0:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns 
`(0, 6)`

Now, same in sympy 1.1:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns
`(0, 3)
`
whereas:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 3)

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT REFLECTION PROMPT MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the reflection prompt
- After each step of the problem process, you are provided with a reflection prompt to prodive some remndiers and guidance about what actions you should take next.
- This prompt is located at the top of the file called reflection_prompt.txt
- At anytime during your workflow, you can update this file to help you solve the issue
- Your updates can provide additional information and helpful reminders to enhace your workflow
- You can also add instructions to enable different workflow paths if you think it will help you with the task
- Be concise and only update the file when you think it will be constructive
- Never remove any existing content. Only append to the existing prompt.

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specfic, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specfic and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.

THOUGHT: I've checked the current behavior of `hstack` and `vstack` for empty matrices and it seems to be working correctly according to the reproduction script I wrote. However, the PR description indicates a change in behavior between sympy 1.0 and 1.1. I need to verify if I'm testing the right thing or if I should look closer at the implementation of `row_join` and `col_join` in different matrix types.

THOUGHT: Wait, I previously saw SUCCESS for the first test in `repro.py` but when I look at the output:
```
Testing sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape with 0 rows:
Result: (0, 6)
SUCCESS
```
This is strange. If it's returning (0, 6), then the issue described in the PR is NOT reproduced in the current version of sympy I'm using (1.1.1rc1). But wait, let me check the code I wrote in `repro.py`.

Ah, I see. In the first test of `repro.py`, I have:
```python
M1 = Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
```
If `hstack` works correctly, it should return (0, 0+1+2+3) = (0, 6).
The PR says that in Sympy 1.1, it returns (0, 3).
But my result shows (0, 6).

Wait, look at the PR description again:
```
Now, same in sympy 1.1:
...
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
returns (0, 3)
```
If my result is (0, 6), then it seems it's already fixed? Or I'm not using the version that has the bug.
Wait, I am using 1.1.1rc1.

Let's look at why it might return (0, 3).
M1 is (0, 0)
M2 is (0, 1)
M3 is (0, 2)
M4 is (0, 3)

If `hstack` uses `reduce(kls.row_join, args)`:
1. `M1.row_join(M2)`:
   M1 is (0, 0), M2 is (0, 1).
   `row_join` in `sympy/matrices/common.py`:
   ```python
   if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
       return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)
   if self.rows != other.rows:
       raise ShapeError(...)
   return self._eval_row_join(other)
   ```
   For M1 (0, 0) and M2 (0, 1):
   `self.cols` is 0. `self.rows` is 0. `other.rows` is 0.
   `self.rows != other.rows` is False.
   So it calls `self._eval_row_join(M2)`.
   `_eval_row_join` returns a new matrix with shape `(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols)` which is `(0, 0 + 1) = (0, 1)`.

2. `(0, 1).row_join(M3)` where M3 is (0, 2):
   `self.cols` is 1. Not 0.
   `self.rows` is 0. `other.rows` is 0.
   Calls `_eval_row_join`. Result shape `(0, 1 + 2) = (0, 3)`.

3. `(0, 3).row_join(M4)` where M4 is (0, 3):
   Result shape `(0, 3 + 3) = (0, 6)`.

So why would it return (0, 3)?
Wait! In the PR description:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns `(0, 3)`.
0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
Where could 3 come from? Maybe it's only taking the last one? No, the last one is (0, 3).

Wait, I might have misread the PR description or it has a typo.
If it returns (0, 3), and the last one is (0, 3).
Wait, if `M1` is (0, 0), and then it joins with `M2` (0, 1), `M3` (0, 2), `M4` (0, 3).

Wait, I see what's happening!
If `self.rows` is 0, what does `self._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols, lambda i, j: entry(i, j))` do?

Let's check `_new` and how it handles 0 rows.

Actually, let's look at `row_join` again in `sympy/matrices/common.py`.

```python
    def row_join(self, other):
        # ...
        # A null matrix can always be stacked (see  #10770)
        if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
            return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)

        if self.rows != other.rows:
            raise ShapeError(
                "`self` and `rhs` must have the same number of rows.")
        return self._eval_row_join(other)
```

And `_eval_row_join`:
```python
    def _eval_row_join(self, other):
        cols = self.cols

        def entry(i, j):
            if j < cols:
                return self[i, j]
            return other[i, j - cols]

        return classof(self, other)._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,
                                         lambda i, j: entry(i, j))
```

Wait, if I am getting (0, 6), then it means I am NOT reproducing the issue.
Is it possible that `sy.Matrix` is different from `sympy.matrices.Matrix`? Unlikely.
In my repro script, I used `from sympy.matrices import Matrix`.

Let me try exactly what's in the PR description.

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > repro2.py
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
print(sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape)
EOF

THOUGHT: Aha! `SparseMatrix.hstack` returns (0, 3).
And wait, why did it return (0, 3)?
M1 (0, 0)
M2 (0, 1)
M3 (0, 2)
M4 (0, 3)

The total number of columns should be 0+1+2+3 = 6.
If it returned (0, 3), it seems it's only taking the last one's columns? No, that's not right either.
Actually, if it's using `reduce`, let's see:
M1 (0, 0)
M2 (0, 1)
M1.row_join(M2) -> (0, 1)
(0, 1).row_join(M3) where M3 is (0, 2) -> (0, 2)? No, should be (0, 3).
Wait, if `(0, 1).row_join(M3)` results in `(0, 2)`, then it's replacing the columns instead of adding them.

Let's check `SparseMatrix.row_join`.

THOUGHT: Found the issue in `SparseMatrix.row_join` (and likely `col_join` too).

```python
        if not self:
            return type(self)(other)
```

If `self` is a 0x1 matrix, `not self` is True because `SparseMatrix.__len__` probably returns 0 for a matrix with no entries.
Wait, let's check `__len__` or how `if not self` is evaluated for `SparseMatrix`.

For `SparseMatrix`, it's likely based on the number of elements.
If a matrix has 0 rows or 0 columns, it has 0 elements.

If `self` has 0 rows and 0 columns, it has 0 elements.
If `self` has 0 rows and 1 column, it also has 0 elements.

So `if not self` is True in both cases.
Then it returns `type(self)(other)`.
If `other` is (0, 2), then it returns a (0, 2) matrix.
So `(0, 1).row_join((0, 2))` returns `(0, 2)`. This is wrong! It should return `(0, 3)`.

This explains why `hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4)` with shapes (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) returns (0, 3).
1. (0,0) join (0,1) -> (0,1)
2. (0,1) join (0,2) -> (0,2)  (because (0,1) is empty)
3. (0,2) join (0,3) -> (0,3)  (because (0,2) is empty)
Result: (0, 3).

Similarly for `col_join`.

Let's check `col_join` in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`.

```bash
grep -n "def col_join" sympy/matrices/sparse.py
```

THOUGHT: Okay, I've confirmed that `SparseMatrix.row_join` and `SparseMatrix.col_join` have the bug.

```python
        if not self:
            return type(self)(other)
```

This should be something like:

```python
        if self.rows == 0 or self.cols == 0:
             # handle the case where self is empty but might have the right number of rows/cols
             # or just proceed with the normal logic if it can handle 0 rows/cols
```

Wait, if `self` has 0 rows and 0 columns, then `type(self)(other)` is correct.
But if `self` has 0 rows and 1 column, and `other` has 0 rows and 2 columns, the result should have 0 rows and 3 columns. `type(self)(other)` will have 0 rows and 2 columns.

Actually, the check `if not self` is very problematic for matrices.

Let's see what happens if we just remove those two lines.

If we remove `if not self: return type(self)(other)`:
For `row_join`:
```python
        A, B = self, other
        if not A.rows == B.rows:
            raise ShapeError()
        A = A.copy()
        if not isinstance(B, SparseMatrix):
             # ...
        else:
            for (i, j), v in B._smat.items():
                A._smat[(i, j + A.cols)] = v
        A.cols += B.cols # Wait, does SparseMatrix have a cols attribute that can be updated?
        return A
```
Wait, I need to see more of `row_join`.

THOUGHT: Yes, it updates `A.cols` at the end. So if we just remove the `if not self` check, it should work fine, provided that `A.rows == B.rows` is checked correctly.

Wait, if `A` is (0, 0) and `B` is (0, 1), `A.rows` is 0 and `B.rows` is 0. `A.rows == B.rows` is True.
`A.cols` is 0.
The loop over `B._smat.items()` will be empty (since B is zeros).
`A.cols += B.cols` will make `A.cols` = 0 + 1 = 1.
So the result will be (0, 1). Correct.

If `A` is (0, 1) and `B` is (0, 2), `A.rows == B.rows` is True (0 == 0).
`A.cols` is 1.
`A.cols += B.cols` will make `A.cols` = 1 + 2 = 3.
So the result will be (0, 3). Correct!

Now let's look at `col_join`.

THOUGHT: Same here for `col_join`. Removing `if not self` should fix it.

Wait, what if `self` is truly empty but we want to maintain the class? `A.copy()` will handle that.
Wait, if `A` is `SparseMatrix` but it's empty, `A.copy()` will return a new `SparseMatrix` that is also empty but has the same dimensions.

What if `self` is a `SparseMatrix` subclass? `type(self)(other)` in the original code would have converted `other` to that subclass.
Using `A.copy()` and then updating it will also maintain the class (assuming `copy()` maintains the class).

Let's check `SparseMatrix.copy`.

THOUGHT: Yes, `copy()` uses `self._new`, which will maintain the correct class.

One more thing: `if not self` is equivalent to `len(self) == 0`.
For `SparseMatrix`, `__len__` is not explicitly defined in the snippets I saw, but it inherits from `MatrixBase` or some other class.

Let's check `__len__` for `SparseMatrix`.

THOUGHT: Wait, so `len(M)` is `rows * cols` even for `SparseMatrix`.
Then `if not self` is True only if `rows * cols == 0`.
This means if `rows == 0` or `cols == 0`.

Case 1: `self` is (0, 1), `other` is (0, 2).
`len(self)` is 0. `if not self` is True.
Returns `type(self)(other)`, which is a (0, 2) matrix. Incorrect, should be (0, 3).

Case 2: `self` is (1, 0), `other` is (1, 1).
`len(self)` is 0. `if not self` is True.
Returns `type(self)(other)`, which is a (1, 1) matrix. Incorrect, should be (1, 1) but it happened to be correct in shape if we only look at columns, but actually it lost the column from `self`. Wait, `self` had 0 columns anyway.
Actually, if `self` is (1, 0) and `other` is (1, 1), `self.row_join(other)` should be (1, 1).
But what if `self` was (1, 0) and `other` was (1, 0)? Result should be (1, 0).

The problem is specifically when one of the dimensions is zero, the `row_join` and `col_join` methods of `SparseMatrix` return the `other` matrix, which might have different dimensions in the other axis (although `row_join` checks `rows`, it doesn't preserve its own `cols`).

Wait, `row_join` checks `A.rows == B.rows`.
If `A` is (0, 1) and `B` is (0, 2):
`A.rows` is 0, `B.rows` is 0. Match!
But `if not A` is True. Returns `B`. Shape (0, 2).

So I should fix both `col_join` and `row_join` in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`.

Actually, there is a better way to check for "emptiness" if that was the intention, but here we actually want to join even if one of them is empty.

Wait, why was `if not self: return type(self)(other)` even there? Probably as an optimization for joining with an empty matrix. But it's incorrect when the empty matrix has a shape that should contribute to the resulting shape.

If `self` is a 3x3 matrix and `other` is a 3x0 matrix, `self.row_join(other)` should be a 3x3 matrix.
In current `SparseMatrix.row_join`:
`self` is not empty (if it has entries).
If `self` is 3x3 and has entries, `if not self` is False.
It proceeds to:
```python
        A.cols += B.cols # 3 + 0 = 3
        return A
```
Correct.

If `self` is 3x3 but has NO entries:
`if not self` is False (because `len` is 9).
It proceeds and returns a 3x3 matrix. Correct.

So the issue is ONLY when `rows * cols == 0`.

Let's see if `DenseMatrix` has this issue. I already tested it and it seemed fine, but let's see its `row_join`.
Actually `DenseMatrix` doesn't seem to override `row_join` from `MatrixBase` (which I think it inherits from `MatrixCommon` via `MatrixRequired`).

Wait, I found `row_join` in `sympy/matrices/common.py`.

```python
    def row_join(self, other):
        # ...
        # A null matrix can always be stacked (see  #10770)
        if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
            return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)

        if self.rows != other.rows:
            raise ShapeError(
                "`self` and `rhs` must have the same number of rows.")
        return self._eval_row_join(other)
```

And `_eval_row_join` in `sympy/matrices/common.py`:
```python
    def _eval_row_join(self, other):
        cols = self.cols

        def entry(i, j):
            if j < cols:
                return self[i, j]
            return other[i, j - cols]

        return classof(self, other)._new(self.rows, self.cols + other.cols,
                                         lambda i, j: entry(i, j))
```
This looks correct as it always uses `self.cols + other.cols`.

So the fix is indeed to fix `SparseMatrix.row_join` and `SparseMatrix.col_join`.

Wait, let's look at `SparseMatrix.row_join` again.

```python
    def row_join(self, other):
        # ...
        if not self:
            return type(self)(other)
```

If I change it to:
```python
        if self.rows != other.rows:
            raise ShapeError()
```
And then let it proceed.

But wait, what if `self` is (0, 0) and `other` is (0, 1)?
The original code would return `type(self)(other)`, which is (0, 1). Correct.
With my proposed change:
`A.rows` (0) == `B.rows` (0).
`A.cols` (0) + `B.cols` (1) = 1.
Returns A with shape (0, 1). Correct.

What if `self` is (1, 1) and `other` is (2, 1)?
Original code:
If `self` is not empty, it raises `ShapeError`.
If `self` is (1, 1) but empty (wait, is that possible? No, `len` is 1).
Wait, if `self` is `SparseMatrix(1, 1, {})`, `len(self)` is 1. So `if not self` is False.
Then it checks `if not A.rows == B.rows:` and raises `ShapeError`. Correct.

So it seems safe to just remove the `if not self` check and rely on the subsequent logic, as long as we keep the `ShapeError` check.

Wait, `SparseMatrix.row_join` does:
```python
        if not self:
            return type(self)(other)
        A, B = self, other
        if not A.rows == B.rows:
            raise ShapeError()
```
If `self` is (0, 1) and `other` is (1, 1).
Original code: `if not self` is True. Returns `type(self)(other)` which is (1, 1).
Wait! This is also wrong! Joining (0, 1) and (1, 1) should be a ShapeError!
Because the number of rows doesn't match (0 vs 1).

Let's test this.
```bash
python -c "from sympy import SparseMatrix; M1 = SparseMatrix(0, 1, {}); M2 = SparseMatrix(1, 1, {}); print(M1.row_join(M2).shape)"
```

THOUGHT: Wow, that's definitely a bug. `SparseMatrix(0, 1).row_join(SparseMatrix(1, 1))` should raise a `ShapeError` because they have different numbers of rows. But it returns a (1, 1) matrix instead.

So, the plan is:
In `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`:
1. In `col_join(self, other)`:
   - Remove the `if not self` check.
   - Ensure `A.cols == B.cols` is checked first.
   - However, wait, there's a special case for `MatrixBase`'s `row_join`:
     ```python
     if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
         return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)
     ```
     Should I also implement this for `SparseMatrix`?
     Actually, this special case says: if I am a matrix with 0 columns, I can be joined with a matrix of any number of rows. I will just "become" a matrix with that many rows but still 0 columns, and then join.
     Wait, that's what it says.

Let's see if `DenseMatrix` does this.
```bash
python -c "from sympy import Matrix; M1 = Matrix(0, 0, []); M2 = Matrix(1, 1, [1]); print(M1.row_join(M2).shape)"

# Edit `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` to fix `col_join` and `row_join`.

I should use `self.rows` and `self.cols` to check for emptiness instead of `not self`, and also handle the special cases of empty matrices correctly to match `MatrixCommon`.

Actually, `SparseMatrix` inherits from `MatrixBase`, but it seems it overrides `row_join` and `col_join`.

Wait, why does it override them? Probably for performance, to work directly with `_smat`.

If I change `row_join` to:

```python
    def row_join(self, other):
        if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
            return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)
        A, B = self, other
        if not A.rows == B.rows:
            raise ShapeError()
        # ... rest of the code ...
```
And remove the `if not self` check.

Wait, if I remove `if not self`, I must ensure that `A.copy()` is efficient and then the rest of the logic works.

Let's see what `if not self` was trying to do. It was probably trying to handle the case where `self` is an empty matrix of any shape, and just return `other`. But as we saw, it's too broad because it also matches matrices with 0 rows but many columns, or vice versa.

Actually, the correct logic for `row_join(self, other)` should be:
1. If `self` has 0 rows and 0 columns, it can take the number of rows of `other`.
2. Otherwise, `self.rows` must equal `other.rows`.
3. The result always has `self.cols + other.cols` columns and `self.rows` rows (after potential adjustment in step 1).

Wait, let's see how `MatrixCommon.row_join` does it:
```python
        if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:
            return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)

        if self.rows != other.rows:
            raise ShapeError(
                "`self` and `rhs` must have the same number of rows.")
```
Wait, if `self` is (0, 0) and `other` is (1, 1).
`self.cols` is 0. `self.rows` (0) != `other.rows` (1).
It returns `self._new(1, 0, []).row_join(other)`.
New `self` is (1, 0). Now `self.rows` (1) == `other.rows` (1).
Then it calls `_eval_row_join`, which returns (1, 0 + 1) = (1, 1). Correct.

What if `self` is (0, 1) and `other` is (1, 1)?
`self.cols` is 1 (not 0).
`self.rows` (0) != `other.rows` (1).
Raises `ShapeError`. Correct.

So I should probably implement the same logic in `SparseMatrix`.

Let's see `col_join`:
In `MatrixCommon` (actually I haven't seen its `col_join` but I expect it's similar).
Let's find it.
```bash
grep -n "def col_join" sympy/matrices/common.py

THOUGHT: I've fixed the issue in `SparseMatrix.row_join` and `SparseMatrix.col_join`, which were incorrectly handling empty matrices by returning the other matrix regardless of shape compatibility or total dimensions. I've verified the fix with reproduction scripts for both `hstack` and `vstack` using `SparseMatrix`. Now I'll check if `ImmutableSparseMatrix` is also affected.

```bash
python -c "from sympy import ImmutableSparseMatrix; M1 = ImmutableSparseMatrix.zeros(0, 1); M2 = ImmutableSparseMatrix.zeros(0, 2); print(ImmutableSparseMatrix.hstack(M1, M2).shape)"

# Fix the bug in `ImmutableSparseMatrix` if it exists.
Wait, I already fixed `SparseMatrix.row_join` and `ImmutableSparseMatrix` inherits from it. So it should be fixed there too. My previous test showed (0, 3) for `ImmutableSparseMatrix.hstack(M1, M2)` where M1 is (0, 1) and M2 is (0, 2), which is correct!

# Conclusion
The issue was specifically in `SparseMatrix` because it overridden `row_join` and `col_join` and had a buggy optimization for empty matrices. Other matrix types (like `DenseMatrix`) use the implementation in `MatrixCommon`, which is correct.

I have:
1. Reproduced the issue with `SparseMatrix`.
2. Identified the cause: an incorrect `if not self` check in `SparseMatrix.row_join` and `SparseMatrix.col_join`.
3. Fixed the issue by adopting the same logic as in `MatrixCommon`, which correctly handles matrices with zero rows or columns.
4. Verified the fix with reproduction scripts.
5. Verified that existing tests for sparse matrices still pass.

One last check: what about `ImmutableDenseMatrix`?
```bash
python -c "from sympy import ImmutableDenseMatrix; M1 = ImmutableDenseMatrix.zeros(0, 1); M2 = ImmutableDenseMatrix.zeros(0, 2); print(ImmutableDenseMatrix.hstack(M1, M2).shape)"

# Summary of Changes
- Modified `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`:
  - Updated `col_join` to handle empty matrices correctly and check for column count compatibility.
  - Updated `row_join` to handle empty matrices correctly and check for row count compatibility.

These changes bring `SparseMatrix` in line with the behavior of other matrix types in Sympy and fix the reported issue.
