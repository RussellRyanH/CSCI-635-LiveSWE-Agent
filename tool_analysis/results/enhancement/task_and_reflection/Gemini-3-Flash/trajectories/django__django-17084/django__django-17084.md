Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT REFLECTION PROMPT MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the reflection prompt
- After each step of the problem process, you are provided with a reflection prompt to prodive some remndiers and guidance about what actions you should take next.
- This prompt is located at the top of the file called reflection_prompt.txt
- At anytime during your workflow, you can update this file to help you solve the issue
- Your updates can provide additional information and helpful reminders to enhace your workflow
- You can also add instructions to enable different workflow paths if you think it will help you with the task
- Be concise and only update the file when you think it will be constructive
- Never remove any existing content. Only append to the existing prompt.

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specfic, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specfic and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.

After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(

aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),

Remember: Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.


Remember: Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

Remember: Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.

After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :

Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.


Remember: Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(

aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),

After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.


Remember: Cannot use aggregate over window functions since 4.2
Description
	 
		(last modified by younes-chaoui)
	 
After upgrading to Django 4.2, I encountered an exception when executing ORM queries that involve aggregates over Window functions. The specific error was psycopg2.errors.GroupingError: aggregate function calls cannot contain window function calls
Dependencies :
psycopg2 version: 2.9.3
django version: 4.2.3
PostgreSQL version: 13.4
Example Code:
queryset = queryset.annotate(
	cumul_DJR=Coalesce(Window(Sum("DJR"), order_by=F("date").asc()), 0.0)
)
aggregate = queryset.aggregate(
	DJR_total=Sum("DJR"),
	cumul_DJR_total=Sum("cumul_DJR")
)

```
