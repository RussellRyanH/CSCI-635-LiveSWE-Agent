Consider the following PR description:
models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.
Description
	
I have models which inherit from other models, and they should inherit the primary key. This works fine with Django 3.1. However, if I install Django 3.2 alpha, when I run make_migrations I get the following error messages:
System check identified some issues:

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT REFLECTION PROMPT MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the reflection prompt
- After each step of the problem process, you are provided with a reflection prompt to prodive some remndiers and guidance about what actions you should take next.
- This prompt is located at the top of the file called reflection_prompt.txt
- At anytime during your workflow, you can update this file to help you solve the issue
- Your updates should provide additional information and helpful reminders to enhance your workflow
- You can also add instructions to enable different workflow paths if you think it will help you with the task
- Be concise and only update the file when you think it will be constructive
- Never remove any existing content. Only append to the existing prompt.
- Anytime your ability to solve the task could benefit from deviating from your standard workflow or you identify important steps that you must take to solve the problem, you MUST add these to the reflection prompt before proceeding!

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specific, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specific and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file
- Anytime you execute commands that provide insight into the issue you are solving, you MUST add these insights to the task description before proceeding!

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: We’re working inside Django’s core repo (observed from the directory structure). The bug likely resides in Django’s system checks related to DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD and primary key detection, probably in django/core/checks/models.py or related model meta logic. I will:
- Append these insights to task_description.txt.
- Enhance reflection_prompt.txt with steps to run targeted tests and focus on the check generating W042.
- Create a small Python editing tool to make precise code changes when we locate the issue.
- Then grep for W042 in the codebase to find the relevant implementation.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: We’re in Django’s core repo, and the warning text likely exists somewhere under django/core/checks or models meta. My previous grep for "W042" returned nothing, so I’ll search for the exact warning message text to locate the check implementation. Once found, I can update task_description.txt and reflection_prompt.txt with concrete pointers.

```bash
grep -Rne "Auto-created primary key used when not defining a primary key type" django || grep -Rne "DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD" django

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: The W042 warning is generated in django/db/models/base.py::_check_default_pk based solely on cls._meta.pk.auto_created. For multi-table inheritance, the child’s pk is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link=True) that points to the parent’s pk. If the parent’s pk was manually specified, the child incorrectly triggers W042. I should inspect options.py to understand pk composition and confirm availability of parent_link attributes to conditionally suppress the warning for inherited, manually specified PKs.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: The W042 warning is emitted in django/db/models/base.py::_check_default_pk when cls._meta.pk.auto_created is True. For multi-table inheritance, the child’s primary key is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link), not an AutoField. The current logic treats any auto_created pk as using DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD and warns erroneously. The fix is to only warn when the auto-created pk is actually an AutoField (or subclass). I’ll:
- Inspect top of base.py for imports to decide how to reference AutoField without circular imports.
- Then, if appropriate, update _check_default_pk to add an isinstance(cls._meta.pk, AutoField) check.
- I’ll append a note to task_description.txt about this finding before editing.

THOUGHT: The warning models.W042 is emitted in django/db/models/base.py::_check_default_pk when cls._meta.pk.auto_created is True. In multi-table inheritance, the child model’s primary key is an auto-created OneToOneField with parent_link=True pointing to the parent’s pk. That field is auto_created but shouldn’t trigger W042 because the pk is explicitly defined on the parent. The fix is to refine the condition to exclude parent_link primary keys (and in general, non-AutoField auto-created PKs). I’ll:
- Append a concise note to task_description.txt reflecting this finding.
- Implement the change by modifying _check_default_pk to also check that the pk is an AutoField and not a parent_link. To avoid circular imports, base.py already imports from django.db.models, so I can import AutoField there or refer via isinstance check safely by adding it to imports.
- Use the dev_edit tool to patch base.py accordingly.

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.


[Update 1 - Repo Insight]

THOUGHT: The W042 warning is emitted in Model._check_default_pk when cls._meta.pk.auto_created is True. For multi-table inheritance, the child pk is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link=True) pointing to the parent’s explicit pk; this should not warn. I will update the task description with this root cause and insert a guard at the start of _check_default_pk to early-return when the auto-created pk is not an AutoField or is a parent_link. This avoids fragile full-condition replacements and minimizes code changes.

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.


[Update 1 - Repo Insight]
- This task is patching Django core (django/ directory present). The issue relates to system check models.W042 raised for inherited manually specified primary keys when using Django 3.2 DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD logic.
- Likely areas: django/core/checks/models.py (system checks), django/db/models/options.py (Meta pk resolution), or fields/auto.py handling of default PKs.

[Update 2 - Root Cause]
- W042 is raised in Model._check_default_pk based solely on pk.auto_created.
- In multi-table inheritance, the child pk is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link=True) to the parent pk; this should not trigger W042 because the pk type is explicitly set on the parent.
- Fix: Only warn when the auto-created pk is an AutoField (or subclass) and not a parent_link field.

[Update 2 - Root Cause and Fix Plan]
- W042 generated in django/db/models/base.py::_check_default_pk based only on pk.auto_created.
- For multi-table inheritance, child pk is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link=True), not an AutoField; warning is a false positive.
- Fix: In _check_default_pk, skip warning if pk is auto-created but not an AutoField or if it is a parent_link.

THOUGHT: I patched Model._check_default_pk to avoid false W042 for inherited parent_link PKs. Now I need to run the relevant Django test subset to validate the change. Django’s test runner is at tests/runtests.py (not at repo root), so I’ll execute the check_framework tests which include W042-related assertions.

```bash
python tests/runtests.py --verbosity=2 check_framework

[Workflow Enhancements]
- Before modifying code, locate W042 check implementation and understand how it determines auto-created PK vs inherited PK.
- Prefer targeted tests (grep for tests referencing W042) to validate changes quickly.
- Ensure changes do not alter expected warnings for truly auto-created PKs; only suppress for subclasses inheriting an explicit PK from a parent.
- After each discovery (grep, reading files), append findings to task_description.txt.

THOUGHT: We fixed Model._check_default_pk to avoid false W042 for inherited parent_link PKs and validated with the check_framework suite (passed). I’ll document this insight in task_description.txt and run the focused model_options.test_default_pk tests to ensure DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD behavior remains correct.

```bash
bash -lc 'printf "\n[Verification]\n- Ran tests: check_framework suite passed after the fix (W042 logic unaffected for valid cases).\n" >> task_description.txt && python tests/runtests.py --verbosity=2 model_options.test_default_pk'

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the reflection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly. Anytime you execute commands that provide insight into the issue you are solving, you MUST add these insights to the task description before proceeding!
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing reflection_prompt.txt when ever you want. Anytime your ability to solve the task could benefit from deviating from your standard workflow or you identify important steps that you must take to solve the problem, you MUST add these to the reflection prompt before proceeding! 


[Workflow Enhancements]
- Before modifying code, locate W042 check implementation and understand how it determines auto-created PK vs inherited PK.
- Prefer targeted tests (grep for tests referencing W042) to validate changes quickly.
- Ensure changes do not alter expected warnings for truly auto-created PKs; only suppress for subclasses inheriting an explicit PK from a parent.
- After each discovery (grep, reading files), append findings to task_description.txt.


Remember: models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.
Description
	
I have models which inherit from other models, and they should inherit the primary key. This works fine with Django 3.1. However, if I install Django 3.2 alpha, when I run make_migrations I get the following error messages:
System check identified some issues:

These models should not use auto-created primary keys! I already defined the primary key in the ancestor of the model. For example class Entity which class User inherits from. It looks to me like a bug in Django 3.2 alpha.


[Update 1 - Repo Insight]
- This task is patching Django core (django/ directory present). The issue relates to system check models.W042 raised for inherited manually specified primary keys when using Django 3.2 DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD logic.
- Likely areas: django/core/checks/models.py (system checks), django/db/models/options.py (Meta pk resolution), or fields/auto.py handling of default PKs.

[Update 2 - Root Cause]
- W042 is raised in Model._check_default_pk based solely on pk.auto_created.
- In multi-table inheritance, the child pk is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link=True) to the parent pk; this should not trigger W042 because the pk type is explicitly set on the parent.
- Fix: Only warn when the auto-created pk is an AutoField (or subclass) and not a parent_link field.

[Update 2 - Root Cause and Fix Plan]
- W042 generated in django/db/models/base.py::_check_default_pk based only on pk.auto_created.
- For multi-table inheritance, child pk is an auto-created OneToOneField (parent_link=True), not an AutoField; warning is a false positive.
- Fix: In _check_default_pk, skip warning if pk is auto-created but not an AutoField or if it is a parent_link.

```

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: I implemented a targeted fix in django/db/models/base.py to prevent models.W042 from being raised for subclasses that inherit a manually specified primary key via a parent_link (multi-table inheritance). I inserted a guard in Model._check_default_pk to skip the warning when the auto-created pk is not an AutoField or is a parent_link field. I validated the change by running:
- tests/check_framework (includes W042-related checks) — passed.
- tests/model_options/test_default_pk — passed.
I also documented findings and verification details in task_description.txt. I’m now submitting the changes.
