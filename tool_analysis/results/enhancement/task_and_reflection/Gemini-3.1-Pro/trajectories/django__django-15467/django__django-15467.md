Consider the following PR description:
ModelAdmin with defined radio_fields override empty_label
Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',
	def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, *args, **kwargs):
		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT REFLECTION PROMPT MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the reflection prompt
- After each step of the problem process, you are provided with a reflection prompt to prodive some remndiers and guidance about what actions you should take next.
- This prompt is located at the top of the file called reflection_prompt.txt
- At anytime during your workflow, you can update this file to help you solve the issue
- Your updates can provide additional information and helpful reminders to enhace your workflow
- You can also add instructions to enable different workflow paths if you think it will help you with the task
- Be concise and only update the file when you think it will be constructive
- Never remove any existing content. Only append to the existing prompt.

**IMPORTANT TASK DESCRIPTION MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the task description 
- You can also update the task description portion of the task description
- The description is located at the top of the file called task_description.txt
- You should add any important notes or details that you discover about the issue that you discover throughout your work
- Update the description with specfic, informative details you learn throughout the problem-solving process
- The details should be used to enhance the existing description by providing depth and narrowing the focus of the issue
- Be specfic and concise, adding only the necessary information that is absent from the description
- You can either add to the original description or create a new one, but ensure that none of the original information is lost
- Do not modify any other part of the file

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.


Remember: ModelAdmin with defined radio_fields override empty_label
Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',
	def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, *args, **kwargs):
		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: The fix described in the PR is:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None`
should be changed to:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`

However, if `kwargs.get('empty_label')` is explicitly set to `None` or empty string, `or _('None')` might override it if it is evaluated as falsy. Wait, if we want to override it with our own, `kwargs.get("empty_label") or _("None")` would work unless someone actually explicitly passed `""` or `False`. But wait, in the PR description, the fix they suggested is:
`kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`
Wait, does it mean if `empty_label` is passed in `kwargs`, we shouldn't override it? Wait, we only want to set it to `_("None")` if it's not already in `kwargs`.
What if it's already in `kwargs`? If it's in `kwargs`, we should probably just use it.
Wait, if it's not in `kwargs`, we use `_("None")` if `db_field.blank else None`.
But what if it *is* in `kwargs` and `db_field.blank` is False? We should probably still respect `kwargs["empty_label"]`?
Wait, if `db_field.blank` is False, the current code always sets `kwargs["empty_label"] = None`.
Wait, if `db_field.blank` is False, does the original code ignore `empty_label` in `kwargs`? Yes, it forces `kwargs["empty_label"] = None`! That seems intended for radio selects, because if the field is not blank, you shouldn't have an empty option (since it's a radio select, if you had an empty option, it would be an option that submits empty value, which would be invalid). But wait! What if the user passed an `empty_label`?
Actually, `db_field.formfield(**kwargs)` will pass `empty_label` to the form field.
For `ChoiceField` (which `radio_fields` uses), `empty_value` or `empty_label` applies.
Wait, the original code sets `empty_label` unconditionally inside `if "widget" not in kwargs:` block. Wait! It sets it unconditionally for `radio_fields`.
But wait! If I just check if `"empty_label" not in kwargs`, I don't override it.
Wait, if `"empty_label" not in kwargs`, then it's a bit different: `kwargs["empty_label"] = kwargs.get("empty_label", _("None") if db_field.blank else None)` or something.
But wait, if `empty_label` is already in `kwargs`, we shouldn't modify it! Wait, if we only set it if not in kwargs?
Let's see:
```python
            elif db_field.name in self.radio_fields:
                kwargs["widget"] = widgets.AdminRadioSelect(
                    attrs={
                        "class": get_ul_class(self.radio_fields[db_field.name]),
                    }
                )
                if "empty_label" not in kwargs:
                    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```
Would this be better than the PR's suggestion? Let's check `formfield_for_choice_field` and other methods.

```bash
grep -C 10 "empty_label" django/contrib/admin/options.py
```

Remember: ModelAdmin with defined radio_fields override empty_label
Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',

			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

THOUGHT: Okay, the PR only modifies `formfield_for_foreignkey` where `kwargs["empty_label"]` is set unconditionally.
Let's see if there are other similar places. What about `kwargs.get('empty_label')`? What if it's explicitly set to an empty string (`""`) or `None`? If they explicitly pass `None`, then `kwargs.get('empty_label')` is `None`, and `or _('None')` evaluates to `_('None')`, overriding the explicit `None` which could be problematic if they intentionally didn't want an empty label despite `blank=True`. Wait, if they pass `empty_label=None`, maybe they don't want an empty label?
Is `empty_label` actually evaluated by truthiness, or just passed as is? `empty_label=None` is the default in some fields, or it means no empty label.
If I use `if 'empty_label' not in kwargs:` it handles all cases.

Wait, what did the user suggest?
```python
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None
```
Wait, if `db_field.blank` is False, the user's code suggests forcing `empty_label` to `None`. But what if the user passed an `empty_label` when `db_field.blank` is False? Should we force it to `None`?
For foreign keys in admin, if the field is not blank, normally there is no empty choice. But actually, forms might allow an empty choice anyway, or maybe they want a custom empty choice.
Wait, for `AdminRadioSelect`, if the field is required (not blank), there is no empty label option, because otherwise you could select it and submit an invalid form? No, Django's ChoiceField has an empty option by default if not required or if there is no default value. If `radio_fields` is used, and the field is not blank (required), typically you shouldn't have an empty radio button unless it's null by default or something? Wait, `django.forms.models.ModelChoiceField` accepts `empty_label` and default is `"---------"`.

Let's test this behavior. I will create a test script mimicking the user's issue.

## LLM response

````text
THOUGHT: The current empty label output is "None". Wait, earlier I wrote `_("None")` in `options.py`, which evaluates to "None". 
The user is expecting "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL". 

Let's modify `django/contrib/admin/options.py` as suggested or similar.

I should check if `kwargs.get('empty_label')` is fully safe. If the user passes `empty_label=""` (empty string) because they *want* it to be empty string, `kwargs.get('empty_label')` evaluates to `""`, which is falsy, so `"" or _('None')` evaluates to `_('None')` - this would override the user's explicit empty string!
However, `kwargs.get('empty_label', _('None'))` will return the user's `""`.
If `db_field.blank` is False, the old code forces `empty_label` to `None`. 
Is this behavior desired?
If the user passes `empty_label="something"`, and `db_field.blank` is False. The original code forced `None`. Should we respect user's `empty_label` when `db_field.blank` is False? The PR description says `kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None`, which suggests they still want `None` if `db_field.blank` is False. Wait, if `db_field.blank` is False, why would you want `empty_label` to be forced to `None`? If they explicitly passed `empty_label`, maybe they want an empty option anyway? Actually, standard Django forms use `empty_label=None` to disable the empty option, which is exactly what we want when `db_field.blank` is False. Wait, if they set `empty_label`, maybe they want to add an empty option even if `db_field.blank` is False?
Wait, if `db_field.blank` is False, the field is required. But in a radio select, if they don't select anything, it's a validation error. If there's an empty option, the user can select it, submit, and get a validation error. Sometimes people *want* an empty option to force the user to make an explicit choice, rather than defaulting to the first option! Yes! RadioSelect defaults to the first choice if no empty option is provided, which means the user might not even look at the field and submit the first choice by default.
But wait, the issue is that it *drops* "empty_label".
Let's see what `formfield_for_choice_field` does. I noticed earlier:

```python
            if "choices" not in kwargs:
                kwargs["choices"] = db_field.get_choices(
                    include_blank=db_field.blank, blank_choice=[("", _("None"))]
                )
```
Notice it checks `if "choices" not in kwargs`.

What if we just check `if "empty_label" not in kwargs:` for foreign key?
If we do:
```python
                if "empty_label" not in kwargs:
                    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```
Then if they provide `empty_label`, we use it regardless of `db_field.blank`. This seems more correct because if they explicitly pass `empty_label`, they probably want it used! But wait, `kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')` is what the PR reporter suggested.

Wait, the Django docs say: "By default the `<select>` widget used by `ModelChoiceField` will have an empty choice at the top of the list. You can change the text of this label (which is `"---------"` by default) with the `empty_label` attribute, or you can disable the empty label entirely by setting `empty_label` to `None`."

If they pass `empty_label=None`, `kwargs["empty_label"]` should be `None`.
If we use `kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')`, if they pass `empty_label=None`, it becomes `None or _('None')` -> `_('None')`! This would break people passing `empty_label=None`!
So we MUST NOT use `or`. We must use `if "empty_label" not in kwargs`.

Let's modify the code in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` and run the tests.

```bash
sed -i 's/kwargs\["empty_label"\] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None/if "empty_label" not in kwargs:\n                    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None/g' django/contrib/admin/options.py

Let's see if there are other occurrences of this pattern in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want.

		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"

THOUGHT: What about `choices` in `formfield_for_choice_field`? I noticed it checks `if "choices" not in kwargs`.
Is there anything else that sets `empty_label` for other widgets?
Let's check if there are any other `kwargs["empty_label"]` in other files that might suffer from the same issue.

THOUGHT: Why did the test fail? `None != 'Custom empty label'`.
Let's look at `tests/admin_widgets/models.py` for `Event` model.
Is `main_band` blank=True? 

If `db_field.blank` is False, the previous implementation forced `empty_label` to `None`. 
Wait, earlier I changed `django/contrib/admin/options.py` so that it uses `if "empty_label" not in kwargs:`

```python
                if "empty_label" not in kwargs:
                    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```

Did I actually save my changes to `django/contrib/admin/options.py` properly?

```bash
cat django/contrib/admin/options.py | grep -n "empty_label" | grep -C 5 kwargs

class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',
	def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, *args, **kwargs):
		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

THOUGHT: If `kwargs["empty_label"]` is successfully set, why is `ff.empty_label` `None` in the test?
Let's see what happens to `ff.empty_label` in `db_field.formfield(**kwargs)`.
Perhaps for `Event`, `main_band` is required (blank=False, null=False). 
If it is required, does `django.forms.models.ModelChoiceField` ignore `empty_label` when required?
Let's check `django/forms/models.py`.

python -c '

        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)
ma = MyModelAdmin(Event, admin.site)

Let me check what `db_field.formfield(**kwargs)` returns. If `db_field.blank` is False, and `empty_label` is passed in kwargs, does `django.db.models.fields.related.ForeignKey.formfield` override it?

Let's trace `ForeignKey.formfield` in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`.

THOUGHT: Wait, in my test script I defined `formfield_for_foreignkey` as:
```python
    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
        if db_field.name == "main_band":
            kwargs["empty_label"] = "Custom empty label"
        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)
```
Wait, my patch `if "empty_label" not in kwargs:` is inside the `if "widget" not in kwargs:` block!
```python
        if "widget" not in kwargs:
            if db_field.name in self.get_autocomplete_fields(request):
                ...
            elif db_field.name in self.radio_fields:
                kwargs["widget"] = widgets.AdminRadioSelect(...)
                if "empty_label" not in kwargs:
                    kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None
```

But what if I used `kwargs["empty_label"]` in my code, but wait! What does `super().formfield_for_foreignkey(...)` do?
Wait, if it's inside `if "widget" not in kwargs:`, then `empty_label` is only set (conditionally) if `widget` is NOT in kwargs!
Wait, if `widget` is NOT in `kwargs`, we enter the block. We check `if "empty_label" not in kwargs:`. Since it IS in `kwargs`, we skip setting it.
So `kwargs["empty_label"]` remains "Custom empty label".
Then we call `db_field.formfield(**kwargs)`. This passes `empty_label="Custom empty label"`.
So why did it evaluate to `None`?
Ah, I see it! Wait!
Is there another place that overrides `empty_label`?

Let's modify the python test script to print `kwargs` just before returning from `super().formfield_for_foreignkey`.

```bash
python -c '

        ff = super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)

Remember: ModelAdmin with defined radio_fields override empty_label
Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):

		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

THOUGHT: Ah! `django/forms/models.py` explicitly does:
```python
        if (required and initial is not None) or (
            isinstance(self.widget, RadioSelect) and not blank
        ):
            self.empty_label = None
        else:
            self.empty_label = empty_label
```
So `ModelChoiceField.__init__` overrides `empty_label` to `None` if `isinstance(self.widget, RadioSelect) and not blank`.
This means no matter what I pass to `kwargs["empty_label"]`, `ModelChoiceField` overrides it to `None` if it's a `RadioSelect` and `blank=False`.
Wait, in `options.py`, `db_field.blank` is passed to `formfield` in some way? Actually `ForeignKey.formfield` passes `blank=self.blank` to `form_class` (which is `ModelChoiceField`).
So `ModelChoiceField` receives `blank=False`. Since `widget` is `AdminRadioSelect` (a subclass of `RadioSelect`), the condition `isinstance(self.widget, RadioSelect) and not blank` is true, so `self.empty_label` is forced to `None`!
Wow. That means overriding `kwargs['empty_label']` in `formfield_for_foreignkey` only works if `db_field.blank` is True!
Let's see if this is true. I'll modify the python script to make the field blank=True.

```bash
python -c '
import django
from django.conf import settings
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "./tests")

THOUGHT: Okay! So when `blank=True`, `empty_label` is respected because `ModelChoiceField` does not force it to `None`.
But wait, if `blank=False`, it forces it to `None` in `ModelChoiceField.__init__`. 
However, the original code in `options.py` did:
`kwargs["empty_label"] = _("None") if db_field.blank else None`

So if the user tried to override `empty_label` when `blank=True`, the original code would override it to `_("None")`.
Now it respects the user's `empty_label`.
Should we change the test case to use a field with `blank=True`?
Yes! `Event.main_band` has `blank=False`. Let's create a test case that uses a field with `blank=True`.
Let's check the fields in `tests/admin_widgets/models.py`.

```bash
grep -n "blank=True" tests/admin_widgets/models.py | grep ForeignKey

Description
	
ModelAdmin drops my "empty_label" and set "default_empty_label". For example:
class MyModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):
	radio_fields = 'myfield',
	def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, *args, **kwargs):
		if db_field.name == 'myfield':
			kwargs['empty_label'] = "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
		return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, *args, **kwargs)
You get never the "I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL"
How to fix it:
In django\contrib\admin\options.py, row 234:
kwargs['empty_label'] = _('None') if db_field.blank else None
Should be changed on:
kwargs['empty_label'] = (kwargs.get('empty_label') or _('None')) if db_field.blank else None

```

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task, if you have learned any additional information about the task that should be added to the task description, or if there are any modifications you can make to the relfection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Note that the task description can be changed by modifying the task_description.txt file directly.

THOUGHT: No other places in `django/contrib/admin/`.
I have verified that the issue is successfully fixed and I have a working test for it inside `tests/admin_widgets/tests.py`.
However, I should be careful not to commit the change to `tests/admin_widgets/tests.py` if the rules strictly restrict to modifying source files. Wait, tests modification is generally good as it tests my fix, but sometimes the instruction says "DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files".
Wait, the prompt said: "DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)"
Oh! I should revert my changes to `tests/admin_widgets/tests.py` and remove my patch files!
Let me read the instructions again:
"DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)"
Okay, I must revert my changes to `tests/admin_widgets/tests.py` immediately.

```bash
git checkout tests/admin_widgets/tests.py && rm -f patch_tests.py patch_tests2.py test_empty_label.py

THOUGHT: The code looks correct. It addresses the user's issue precisely without potentially overriding user-provided empty strings or Falsy `empty_label` configurations. And it leaves testing unchanged as requested.
I have cleaned up any patches and testing scripts. Now I will submit the work.
