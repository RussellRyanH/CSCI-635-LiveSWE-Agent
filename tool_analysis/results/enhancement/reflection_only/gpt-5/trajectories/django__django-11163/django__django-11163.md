Consider the following PR description:
model_to_dict() should return an empty dict for an empty list of fields.
Description
	
Been called as model_to_dict(instance, fields=[]) function should return empty dict, because no fields were requested. But it returns all fields
The problem point is
if fields and f.name not in fields:
which should be
if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

**IMPORTANT REFLECTION PROMPT MODIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Updating the reflection prompt
- After each step of the problem process, you are provided with a reflection prompt to provide some reminders and guidance about what actions you should take next.
- This prompt is located at the top of the file called reflection_prompt.txt
- At anytime during your workflow, you can update this file to help you solve the issue
- Your updates should provide additional information and helpful reminders to enhance your workflow
- You can also add instructions to enable different workflow paths if you think it will help you with the task
- Be concise and only update the file when you think it will be constructive
- Never remove any existing content. Only append to the existing prompt.
- Anytime your ability to solve the task could benefit from deviating from your standard workflow or you identify important steps that you must take to solve the problem, you MUST add these to the reflection prompt before proceeding!

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if there are any modifications you can make to the reflection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want. Anytime your ability to solve the task could benefit from deviating from your standard workflow or you identify important steps that you must take to solve the problem, you MUST add these to the reflection prompt before proceeding!

Reflect on the previous trajectories and decide if there are any tools you can create to help you with the current task or if there are any modifications you can make to the reflection prompt to enhance your workflow. 
Note that just because you can use basic bash commands doesn't mean you should not create any tools that can still be helpful.
Also note, you can update the reflection prompt by editing "reflection_prompt.txt" when ever you want. Anytime your ability to solve the task could benefit from deviating from your standard workflow or you identify important steps that you must take to solve the problem, you MUST add these to the reflection prompt before proceeding!

THOUGHT: I'll add a helpful note to the reflection prompt to favor lightweight, stub-based reproductions over running the full test suite. Then I'll create and run a small Python script that uses a stubbed instance to reproduce the current bug in model_to_dict (expecting it to wrongly return all fields when fields=[]). This will confirm the issue before I patch the code.

```bash
printf "\n- Prefer creating lightweight stub-based reproduction scripts instead of running the full Django test suite; importing django.forms.models is fine without DB/settings.\n- When fixing filter logic, check the behavior for fields=None vs fields=[] and exclude interactions with simple stubs.\n" >> reflection_prompt.txt && cat <<'EOF' > run_check.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Reproduce model_to_dict behavior with stubs (no DB/settings required)
from django.forms.models import model_to_dict

class StubField:
    def __init__(self, name, editable=True):
        self.name = name
        self.editable = editable
    def value_from_object(self, instance):
        return getattr(instance, self.name, None)

class StubMeta:
    def __init__(self, fields):
        self.concrete_fields = fields
        self.private_fields = []
        self.many_to_many = []

class StubInstance:
    def __init__(self):
        self.foo = "FOO"
        self.bar = "BAR"
        self._meta = StubMeta([StubField("foo"), StubField("bar")])

inst = StubInstance()
print("fields=None ->", model_to_dict(inst, fields=None))
print("fields=[]   ->", model_to_dict(inst, fields=[]))
EOF
python run_check.py

THOUGHT: The bug is in django/forms/models.py where model_to_dict uses "if fields and ..." which treats an empty list like None, causing all fields to be included. I'll update that condition to "if fields is not None and ..." so fields=[] returns an empty dict. Then I'll rerun the lightweight stub script to confirm the fix.

```bash
sed -i 's/if fields and f.name not in fields:/if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:/' django/forms/models.py && python run_check.py
```

- Prefer creating lightweight stub-based reproduction scripts instead of running the full Django test suite; importing django.forms.models is fine without DB/settings.

THOUGHT: I fixed the conditional in model_to_dict to handle fields=[] correctly and verified with a lightweight stub that fields=None returns all fields while fields=[] returns an empty dict. I also updated the reflection prompt. I'll now submit the changes.

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
