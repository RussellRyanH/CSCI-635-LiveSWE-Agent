Consider the following PR description:
HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects
Description
	
I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:
from django.http import HttpResponse																	 
# String content
response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is correct
# Bytes content
response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		 
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is also correct
# memoryview content
response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))															 
response.content
# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'
# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

**IMPORTANT TOOL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS**
## Creating your own tools 
- You can also create your own tools in Python to help with your workflow
- Compared to basic bash commands, the tools you create should be able to better aid your workflow in solving the task
- Ensure each tool you create is in Python, contains informative outputs or error messages, and can be ran from the command line
- You should at least create a simple edit tool that can help you effectively edit arbitrary files instead of using bash commands
- The tools you create can be for any purpose, it does not need to be general, instead think about how it can help you specifically with the current task at hand

### Example of creating a custom tool:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I noticed that in order to solve the issue I need to ... therefore I should create a custom tool to help me ...

```bash
cat <<'EOF' > /path/to/tool_name.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
# Import other packages if needed

def main():
    # Your tool logic here
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
EOF
```
</example_response>

### Example of using the tool you created:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: Let me use the custom tool I created to help me with ...

```bash
python /path/to/tool_name.py <<EOF
your_input_here
EOF
```
</example_response>

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.
