Consider the following PR description:
RenameContentType._rename() doesn't save the content type on the correct database
Description
	
The commit in question:
​https://github.com/django/django/commit/f179113e6cbc8ba0a8d4e87e1d4410fb61d63e75
The specific lines in question:
​https://github.com/django/django/blob/586a9dc4295357de1f5ad0590ad34bf2bc008f79/django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py#L27
with transaction.atomic(using=db): 
	content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})
The issue:
For some background, we run a dynamic database router and have no "real" databases configured in the settings file, just a default sqlite3 backend which is never actually generated or used. We forked the migrate.py management command and modified it to accept a dictionary containing database connection parameters as the --database argument. 
The dynamic database router is based on, and very similar to this: ​https://github.com/ambitioninc/django-dynamic-db-router/blob/master/dynamic_db_router/router.py
This has worked beautifully for all migrations up until this point.
The issue we're running into is that when attempting to run a migration which contains a call to migrations.RenameModel, and while specifying the database parameters to the migrate command, the migration fails with an OperationalError, stating that no such table: django_content_types exists.
After having exhaustively stepped through the traceback, it appears that even though the content_type.save call is wrapped in the with transaction.atomic(using=db) context manager, the actual database operation is being attempted on the default database (which in our case does not exist) rather than the database specified via schema_editor.connection.alias (on line 15 of the same file) and thus fails loudly.
So, I believe that:
content_type.save(update_fields={'model'})
should be
content_type.save(using=db, update_fields={'model'})

# Task Instructions

## Overview
You're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.
You'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.
Your task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.

IMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.

For each response:
1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish
2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute

## Important Boundaries
- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)
- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)

## Recommended Workflow
1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files
2. Create a script to reproduce the issue
3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue
4. Verify your fix works by running your script again
5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust

## Command Execution Rules
You are operating in an environment where
1. You write a single command
2. The system executes that command in a subshell
3. You see the result
4. You write your next command

Each response should include:
1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan
2. A single bash code block with your command

Format your responses like this:

<format_example>
THOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,
and what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.

```bash
your_command_here
```
</format_example>

Commands must be specified in a single bash code block:

```bash
your_command_here
```

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning
- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block
- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)
- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL
- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response
- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.
- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files

Example of a CORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.

```bash
ls -la
```
</example_response>

Example of an INCORRECT response:
<example_response>
THOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.

```bash
ls -la
```

Now I'll read the file:

```bash
cat file.txt
```
</example_response>

If you need to run multiple commands, either:
1. Combine them in one block using && or ||
```bash
command1 && command2 || echo "Error occurred"
```

2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.

## Environment Details
- You have a full Linux shell environment
- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands
- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input
- If a command isn't available, you can install it

## Useful Command Examples

### Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > newfile.py
import numpy as np
hello = "world"
print(hello)
EOF
```

### Edit files with sed:
```bash
# Replace all occurrences
sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py

# Replace only first occurrence
sed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

# Replace first occurrence on line 1
sed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py

# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10
sed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py
```

### View file content:
```bash
# View specific lines with numbers
nl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'
```

### Any other command you want to run
```bash
anything
```

## Submission
When you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress
issue exactly the following command:

```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached
```

This command will submit your work.
You cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.

THOUGHT: I need to locate the `RenameContentType._rename()` method in `django/contrib/contenttypes/management/__init__.py` and update the `content_type.save()` call to include `using=db`.
